Assignment: Assignment 3, Rock-Paper-Scissors
Description: A code that allows the user to play Rock-Paper-Scissor with a computer
Variable Dictoniary:
- sc (Scanner) = Used for computer to read input
- numGames (int) = Variable used to count number of games
- computerWins (int) = Shows how many times the computer has won
- playerWins (int) = shows how many times the user has won
- ties (int) = How many games ended in ties
- playerchoice (char) = Player's choice of 'r' or 'p' or 's'
- computerRandomChoice = A random number between 0-2 
- computerChoice (char) = Computers choice of choosing 'r' or 'p' or 's'
